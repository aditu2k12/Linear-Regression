# Bike Sharing Assignment

> BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation endsÂ across the nation due to Covid-19.
They want to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends, specifically which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes and how well those variables describe the bike demands. We are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables

## General Information

* They want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:
    * Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
    * How well those variables describe the bike demands

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions

-  The linear regression model was able to predict bike demand precisely with an R2 Score of 80%.
